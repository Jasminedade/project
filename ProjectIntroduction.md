INTRODUCTION OF PROJECT

The project is about graphical table reservation app in which people can easily book their tables at home. 
Anyone who is shy or who wants to meet a person privately then they can reserve their table far away from the public. 
In this app people can see different offers and other things. 
By making this app everyone can get benefit as restaurant staff can get rid of interaction with customers and telling them where to sit and if table is available or not as well as people get benefit from selecting their own place to sit meet their closed ones. 
So this is the whole project that i suggested.
